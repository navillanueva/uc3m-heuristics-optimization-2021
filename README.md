# Optimization Sort Algortihm
Final project for Algorithm Optimization Course. 

The problem consisted of a docking port for containers, two types (standard and refrigerated), and a map of the cells that a boat in the docking port 
has to store these containers, two types of cell (normal and electric). Each action of loading and unloading had a cost. A python program that optimized 
the cost of loading these containers in an organized way is what was asked for. The program would receive a "containers.txt" file with the list of containers 
that had to be docked on the boat, and "mapa.txt" file which represented the map of cells available for docking in the boat.

These repository includes the code to resolve this problem, several txt files that create different scenarious and a pdf with everything explained (in spanish).
